<font size="4" face=Gadugi color="black">   Computer is an electronic device that can do arithmetic and logical processes with data and shelter the results of the processes and bring back when it is wanted. Many computer scientists have done several things to develop computer for years and they are still continuing. Konrad Zuse is one of the best scientists who work about computer.

   He was born 22 June 1910 in Germany. He was a construction engineer, inventor and computer pioneer. He designed something called the Z1 that is the first mechanical calculator which can be programmed. He encountered problem because it worked mechanically and didn’t work with electric. He improved the Z1 and he made something called the Z2 that is the first digital and memory computer by using telephone relays. He didn’t go soldiering for the Second World War but he worked in Aircraft factory and he made special calculator(S1 and S2) that can measure airfoil for flying bombs.

     He got support from German Research Institute for Aviation and he set up a company. He had been improved the Z2 and then he make the Z3 after 3 months in 1941 in his company. The Z3 was a binary floating point calculator featuring programmability with loops and also it is based on telephone relays with memory. The Z3 is defined that the first fully operational electromechanical computer. After he had made Z3, he improved the S1 and the S2 which computed aerodynamic corrections to the wings of radio controlled flying bombs. The S2 featured an analog digital converter with program control and it the first process-controlled computer in 1944.

 He went to Allgau after he had gone to Göttingen with army that stood back. He made the Z4 in the barn. When Zuse worked on Z4, Zuse realised that programming of machine code was very complicated thereupon he had started to work this topic. He wrote the world’s first chess-playing program by using Plankalkül. Zuse KG was set in 1949 after World War 2 and many computers that have first letter is Z were produced.Z22 store up datas on magnetic storage by using cathode lamps. Zuse KG had produced 251 computers until 1967 but it was sold to Siemens because of financial problems. Zuse died because of heart failure on 18 December 1995 in Hünfeld.
